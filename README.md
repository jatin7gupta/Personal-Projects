# Personal Projects

* **[Microsoft-Malware-Detection](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Microsoft-Malware-Detection/)**: A machine learning project to learn and understand different concepts of machine learning. We experimented with different encodings and machine learning algorithm and benchmarked on a balanced dataset.

* **[Cancer-Cells-Detection-Tracking](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Cancer-Cells-Detection-Tracking/)**: Detecting and Tracking cancer (HeLa) cells using Computer Vision techniques. The project also detects cell division and analyses cell motion such as speed, distance travelled etc. The project uses OpenCV3 for image processing.

* **[Doqutor](https://doqutor.github.io/doqutor-core/)**: Identification and simulation of automated security incident response using AWS serverless stack.

 * **[Product-Quantization](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Product-Quantization/)**:This project implements a product quantization-based approach for approximate nearest neighbor search using Inverted multi-index.
 
 * **[Collision-Counting-Locality-Sensitive-Hashing](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Collision-Counting-Locality-Sensitive-Hashing/)**: This is the implementation for C2LSH algorithm using PySpark with constraints. C2LSH algorithm searches the nearest neighbours (Euclidian space) from the given data points by accepting nearest neighbours using features in the datapoints.
 
 
 * **[Settle In Sydney](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Settle-In-Sydney/)**: A machine learning solution to help you settle in Sydney, Australia.
 
 * **[Olympic Medals Data Visualization](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Olympic_Medals_Data_Visualization/)**: Visualization of Olympic Medals Data using pandas and matplotlib.
 
 * **[Routers: Link State Protocol](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Routers-Link-State-Protocol/)**: A simulation of Link State Protocol using Python.

 
 * **[Longest Ordered Word Ladder](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Longest-Ordered-Word-Ladder/)**: Engineering a solution for Ordered Word Ladders.
 
 * **[Sliding Tile Puzzle](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Sliding-Tile-Puzzle/)**: Implementation of Sliding Tile Puzzle in C.
 
 
 * **[Ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Ultimate-tic-tac-toe/)**: AI assignment using mini-max algorithm to play again a predefined opponent on server.
 
 * **[Tangram](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/Tangram/)**: Implementation of tangram puzzle using Python3. Tangram is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, which are put together to form shapes.
 
  * **[Learn How To Learn](https://github.com/jatin7gupta/Learn-How-To-Learn)**: Implementation personal blog in order to learn Angular 4.
  
* **[ImmersiveEducator](https://jatin7gupta.github.io/imedu.github.io/)**: A UNITY based immersive (VR) gaming platform for android to help kids aged 8 to 14 years learn programming while having fun solving challenges.
